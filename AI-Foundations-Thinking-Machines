Artificial Intelligence FoundationsÇ Thinking Machines

Chapter 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?
  Define General Intelligence:
    • AI: Any system that exhibits behavior that could be interpreted as human intelligence.

  The History of AI: 
    • Combinatorial Explosions: A situation where the number of possible combinations or outcomes grows rapidly as the size of the problem or the number of variables increases.

  Strong vs. Weak AI:
    • Strong AI: Machine displays all person-like behavior. Artificial Beings that have emotions, a sense of purpose, and can even tell jokes, may be almost sarcastic.
    • Weak AI/Narrow AI: Machine is confined to a very superficial/narrow task.

  Plan AI: 
    • Planning Artificial Intelligence: When you still have to plan out how to match symbols and patterns.

Chapter 2: The Rise of Machine Learning | Chapter 3: Finding the Right Approach
  Machine Learning | Data Reasoning: 
    • Symbolic Reasoning: Abstract problem, but know the steps for resolution. (Long setup and no outside data).
    • Machine Learning: Look for patterns, to come up with the likeliest answer. (Lots of data that needs tweaking/updating).

Chapter 4: Common AI Problems
  Natural Language Processing:
    • Natural Language Processing: When you interact with a machine using your natural language.

  The Internet of Things/IoT:
    • IoT: The collective network of connected devices and the technology that facilitates communication between devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves.
