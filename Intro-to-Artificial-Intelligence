Chapter 1: What is AI? 
  Define General Intelligence:
    â€¢ Computer Intelligence and Human Intelligence start from very different places.


Chapter 2: The Rise of Machine Learning
  Machine Learning:
    â€¢ Program a system to become intelligent through observation, by sensing data, and by learning through data. Machines could continue to grow with more data.

  Artificial Neural Networks:
    â€¢ Artificial Neural Network: AI System that mimics the structure of the human brain; The artificial neural network uses hundreds (or millions) of numerical dials.
    â€¢ Neural networks are Machine Learning systems; Networks need access to huge amounts of data.
    â€¢ Guesses:
