Machine Learning Foundations: Linear Algebra

• Defining Linear Algebra: 
  - Algebra: A branch of mathematics that uses mathematical statements to describe relationships between things that may vary.
  - Linear Algebra: A branch of mathematics that lets you concisely describe coordinates and interactions of planes in higher dimensions and perform operations on them.
  -  A.K.A., Linear Algebra is the study of vectors and linear functions.

• Main Building Blocks and Areas:
  - Systems of linear equations, vectors and matrices, linear transformations, determinants, and vector spaces (the study of vectors and linear functions).
